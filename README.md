**Lab Recruits** is a 3D computer game intended for testing AI. It is work in progress as we work on adding more game features. You can create your own multi-floor level using a CSV file to challenge your AI. A level is in principle a maze with decorative and dynamic game objects. Dynamic game objects include doors, switches to operate doors, fire, and goal flags. Switches and doors can be linked in many-to-many relations to create a challenging puzzle. The game does not have an explicit end-game plot, other than to collect as many points as possible (and surviving the level). Since there is a maximum in how much point can be obtained in a level, reaching the maximum point can be interpreted as finishing the level.

#### To Build

The project was developed for Unity 2019.2.6f1, so you need this version to build the project.

Open the project in Unity. From there, there should be a menu item to build the executable. The game can be built for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

### Manual

How to play the game, how to create a level: see the wiki.
