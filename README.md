**Lab Recruits** is a 3D computer game intended for testing AI. It is work in progress as we work on adding more game features. You can create your own multi-floor level using a CSV file to challenge your AI. A level is in principle a maze with decorative and dynamic game objects. Dynamic game objects include doors, switches to operate doors, fire, and goal flags. Switches and doors can be linked in many-to-many relations to create a challenging puzzle. The play goal can simpply be to explore the level, or to collect as many points as possible. Since version 2.2 we can put a goal-flag with id "Finish". Touching it will mark the game as finished/gameover. So a possible play goal can be to find and touch this gloa-flag. Also, since version 2.2 we can put infected humans (monsters) in the level; they will hurt the player if they manage to touch the latter.

#### To Build

The project was developed for Unity 2019.2.6f1, so you need this version to build the project.

Open the project in Unity. From there, there should be a menu item to build the executable. The game can be built for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

### Manual

How to play the game, how to create a level: see the wiki.
